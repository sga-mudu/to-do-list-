# to-do-list-

https://sga-mudu.github.io/to-do-list-/


I have done this project because it seems interesting to do. 
During this project i have learned these things :
  1) How to manipulate list using Javascript
  2) How i can store the input or data that was provided by the user
  3) Logic behind the button
